I am a second-year PhD student in the Deparment of Biomedical Engineering at Johns 
Hopkins University. I am advised by Joshua Vogelstein in the
[Neurodata](https://neurodata.io/) lab. My work focuses on using statistical and 
computational techniques to help understand
[nanoscale connectomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02208-0). 

I am also a co-developer of [GraSPy](https://graspy.neurodata.io/), an open-source 
Python package for doing statistical analyses of network-valued data. I am broadly 
interested in making data analysis techniques in neuroscience more accessible through 
open-source software.
