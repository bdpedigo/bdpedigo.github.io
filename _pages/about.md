I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Deparment of Biomedical Engineering at Johns 
Hopkins University. I am advised by Joshua Vogelstein in the
[Neurodata](https://neurodata.io/) lab. My work focuses on using statistical and 
computational techniques to help understand
[nanoscale connectomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02208-0). 

I am also a developer of [graspologic](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic) 
(formerly called GraSPy), an open-source 
Python package for doing statistical analyses of network data which we now co-develop with
Microsoft Research. I am broadly interested in making data analysis techniques in 
neuroscience more accessible through open-source software. 

About me
---
I grew up in [Lake Forest Park, WA](https://goo.gl/maps/DdsMTKyRPeEFe5yK9), just north
of Seattle. I received a B.S. in Bioengineering from the University of Washington. 
While I was there, I worked in Dr. Chet Moritz's lab, investigating whether optogenetic
techniques could help restore motor function after a spinal cord injury. I also spent a
summer as an intern at the
[Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/), 
working on a project to collect a nanoscale connectome from a cubic millimeter of mouse
visual cortex. During my PhD, I was an intern with Team Essex at Microsoft Research, 
exploring techniques for graph and sequence embeddings and visualization.

Outside of research, I enjoy birdwatching, biking, backpacking, and bouldering.
