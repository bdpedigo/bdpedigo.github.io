I am a Scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, focused on data science
techniques for helping to understand nanoscale connectomes.

I did my PhD in the Deparment of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University,
advised by Joshua Vogelstein and Carey Priebe in the [NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/)
lab. My thesis developed statistical and computational techniques for analyzing
connectome data, and applied them to the
[the connectome of an insect brain](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add9330).

I am also a developer of [graspologic](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic), an open-source
Python package for doing statistical analyses of network data which we now co-develop with
Microsoft Research. I am broadly interested in making data analysis techniques in
neuroscience more accessible through open-source software.

## About me

I grew up in [Lake Forest Park, WA](https://goo.gl/maps/DdsMTKyRPeEFe5yK9), just north
of Seattle. I received a B.S. in Bioengineering from the University of Washington.
There I worked in Dr. Chet Moritz's lab, investigating whether optogenetic
techniques could help with restoring motor function after spinal cord injuries. I also
spent a summer as an intern at the
[Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/),
working on a project to collect a nanoscale connectome from a cubic millimeter of mouse
visual cortex. During my PhD, I was an intern with Team Essex at Microsoft Research,
exploring techniques for graph and sequence embeddings and visualization.

Outside of research, I enjoy birdwatching, biking, and backpacking.
