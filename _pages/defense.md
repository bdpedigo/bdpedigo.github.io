**Who:**
Ben! And hopefully you!

**What:** 
Ben will be defending his PhD thesis - this is a talk, open to the public, where 
Ben will describe the research he has done over the last five years as part of his 
thesis research. Along with his written thesis, this is the last milestone as part of
successfully "defending" his thesis and getting his PhD.

**When:**
Friday, June 23rd, 2023
12:00 PM (Noon) *Eastern Time*

**Where:**
Clark Hall, Johns Hopkins University, Homewood Campus
Room 110

OR

Zoom Meeting: https://JHUBlueJays.zoom.us/j/95377851708?pwd=NVFlRStZSzg4SEFxNGlKWVBxeWI3QT09
Meeting ID: 953 7785 1708
Passcode: 184998

**Why:**
The PhD defense is also traditionally somewhat of a celebration - if you're seeing 
this, you've been a helpful part of Ben's journey towards getting a PhD, and he is 
grateful for that! You are welcome to join the fun and hear about Ben's research, but 
there is absolutely *no pressure to attend or watch on Zoom.*
